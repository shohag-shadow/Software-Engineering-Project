# **University Management System**  
### Making Academic Activities Easier with the Incremental SDLC Model  

---

## **About the Project**  
The **University Management System (UMS)** is software that helps universities with their academic work. It will automate tasks like submitting assignments, creating class timetables, assigning teachers to courses, and publishing results.  

The project uses the **Incremental Model** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This means the software will be built step by step, adding features gradually while improving it based on user feedback.

## **Why Use the Incremental Model?**  
The Incremental Model is a good choice for this project because:

- Important features are delivered first, so users can start using them early.  
- Feedback from students, teachers, and staff helps improve the system.  
- It reduces risks because the software is built and tested in small parts.  
- New features can be added easily in the future.

## **Main Features**  
1. **Assignment Management**:  
   - Students can upload their assignments online.  
   - Teachers can grade the assignments and give feedback.  

2. **Automatic Class Scheduling**:  
   - Creates class timetables automatically.  
   - Avoids clashes in class times, rooms, or teacher schedules.  

3. **Teacher-Course Assignment**:  
   - Deans can assign teachers to different courses.  
   - Keeps track of how much work each teacher has.  

4. **Result Management**:  
   - Teachers can upload student grades.  
   - Students can see their grades in a secure portal.

## **Steps to Build the System**  

### **Step 1: Collect Requirements**  
- Talk to students, teachers, and university staff to understand their needs.  
- Decide which features are most important and start with them.  

### **Step 2: Design the System**  
- Plan how the software will work and how each part will connect.  
- Make sure the system can grow in the future by adding new features.  

### **Step 3: Build the System in Parts**  

#### **Part 1: Assignment Management**  
   - Students can submit assignments online.  
   - Teachers can grade and give feedback.  

#### **Part 2: Class Routine Generator**  
   - Creates conflict-free timetables.  
   - Shows schedules to students and teachers.  

#### **Part 3: Teacher-Course Assignment**  
   - Helps deans assign teachers to courses.  
   - Makes workload management easier.  

#### **Part 4: Result Management**  
   - Allows teachers to upload grades.  
   - Students can view their grades securely.  

### **Step 4: Test the System**  
- Test every part to make sure it works properly.  
- Fix any problems and improve the system based on user feedback.  

### **Step 5: Deploy and Maintain**  
- Release each part of the system when it is finished.  
- Update the system regularly to fix bugs and add improvements.

## **Benefits of the Incremental Model**  
1. **Quick Results**: Users can use important features early.  
2. **Better Feedback**: Users help make the system better.  
3. **Less Risk**: Building in small steps makes it easier to find and fix problems.  
4. **Future Growth**: New features can be added without breaking the system.

## **Future Features**  
- A system for tracking attendance.  
- Dashboards to analyze student performance.  
- Notifications for updates and announcements.
