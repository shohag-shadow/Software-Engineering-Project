# **University Management System** 
### Automating Academic Activities with the Incremental SDLC Model

--- 

## **About the Project** 
This is software that assists universities in carrying out their academic activities. The University Management System will automate the assignment submission, class timetable management, teacher course allocation, result publication, etc.

This project uses Incremental Model for the software development life cycle. That means software is developed step by step and features added along with improvements based on users' feedback.

**Why the Incremental Model**

The development of this project suits the Incremental Model in view of the fact that:

Important features are delivered first so that users can start using them early.
Feedback from students, teachers, and staff improves the system.
It reduces risks because software is built and tested in small parts.
A new feature can be added with ease in the near future.

## **Main Features**  
1. **Assignment Management**:  
   - Students can upload assignments online.  
   - Grading of assignments by teachers can be uploaded with their feedback.  

2. **Automatic Class Scheduling**:  
   - Automatic generation of class timetables.
   - Avoids conflicts in class timings, rooms, or teacher schedules.  

3. **Teacher Course Assignment**
   - Deans can assign a teacher to various courses.
   - The workload of each teacher can be tracked by this module.
  
4. **Result Management**
   - Teachers can upload grades for the students.
   - Grades are visible to students through a secure portal.

## Procedure to Create the System 

### Step 1: Get Requirement 
   - Acquire the requirements from students, teachers, and university staff as to what all features they need.
   - Find out the most essential features and begin the development with those foremost. 

### Step 2: Design the System 
   - Find out how the software system is going to work in adding related activity between different modules.
   - It should be expandable, so that in the future, more features can be integrated into the system.  

### **Step 3: Part-by-Part Development of the System**  

 #### **Part 1: Assignment Management**  
   - It enables students to submit assignments online.  
   - The Student will be able to submit an assignment; the teacher will be able to value those sites.  

  #### **Part 2: Class Routine Generator**
   - Generates conflict-free agendas.  
   - Shows agenda to student-teachers.  

  #### **Part 3: Teacher-Course Assignment**  
   - Assists deans in assigning courses to teachers.  
   - Thus, it initiated a way of managing the workload.  

  #### **Part 4: Result Management**  
   - Involves uploading grades by teachers.
   - Grades can be viewed privately by students. 

### **Step 4: Test the System** 
   - The responsiveness of each part should be trialed.
   - After debugging, enhancing the system and then user experience.

### **Step 5: Deployment and Maintenance** 
   - Deploying each module of the system as it is ready.
   - The system should undergo regular maintenance in the form of bug fixes and improvements being uploaded.

## **Future Attributes-**
- Attendance-measuring system.
- Analytical dashboards on the performance of students.
- Notification updates and announcements.
