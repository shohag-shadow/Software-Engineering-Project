# **University Management System**  
### Automating Academic Activities with the Incremental SDLC Model  

---

## **Project Overview**  
The **University Management System (UMS)** is designed to automate and streamline core academic activities in universities. These activities include managing assignments, generating class schedules, assigning teachers to courses, and publishing results. The system aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and enhance user experience for students, faculty, and administrators.  

The project follows the **Incremental Model** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to deliver functionalities in a phased and systematic manner, ensuring flexibility and adaptability throughout development.

### **Why the Incremental Model?**  
The Incremental Model is ideal for this project as it:  
- Delivers critical functionalities early for faster stakeholder value.  
- Incorporates user feedback effectively after each phase.  
- Reduces development risks through smaller, iterative increments.  
- Ensures scalability for future expansions.

## **Key Features**  
1. **Assignment Management**:  
   - Students can submit assignments online.  
   - Teachers can view, grade, and provide feedback seamlessly.  

2. **Automatic Class Scheduling**:  
   - Automatically generates conflict-free class schedules.  
   - Considers room availability, teacher preferences, and student batch sizes.  

3. **Teacher-Course Assignment**:  
   - Allows deans to assign teachers to courses transparently.  
   - Tracks teacher workload for equitable distribution.  

4. **Result Management**:  
   - Facilitates grading and secure publication of results.  
   - Offers students a portal to view their grades and transcripts.

## **Project Development Phases**  

### **Phase 1: Requirement Analysis**
- Collaborate with students, teachers, and administrators to document key requirements.  
- Identify high-priority features like assignment submission and timetable generation.  
- Categorize functionalities into increments for phased delivery.  

### **Phase 2: System Design**  
- Develop a modular, scalable system architecture.  
- Plan each increment to ensure smooth integration and deployment.  

### **Phase 3: Incremental Development**  
#### **Increment 1: Assignment Management System**  
   - Online submission and grading of assignments.  
   - Student and teacher interfaces for interaction.  

#### **Increment 2: Automatic Class Routine Generator**  
   - Generates class timetables considering constraints.  
   - Admin dashboard for managing schedules.  

#### **Increment 3: Teacher-Course Assignment System**  
   - Allows deans to assign teachers to courses.  
   - Tracks and balances teacher workload.  

#### **Increment 4: Result Management System**  
   - Grading and result publication for students.  
   - Secure student access to results and transcripts.  

### **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**  
- Conduct unit and integration testing after each increment.  
- Gather user feedback for iterative improvements.  

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**  
- Deploy increments as they are completed for early adoption.  
- Continuously update the system to incorporate improvements.

## **Advantages of Using the Incremental Model**  
1. **Early Delivery**: High-priority functionalities are available early in development.  
2. **User-Centric Approach**: Stakeholder feedback is incorporated continuously.  
3. **Risk Reduction**: Smaller, manageable increments reduce failure risks.  
4. **Scalability**: Modular development ensures easy integration of future features.
